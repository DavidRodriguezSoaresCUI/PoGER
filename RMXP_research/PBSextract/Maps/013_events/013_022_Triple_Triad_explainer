When 'Basics'
  Show Text "\\rTriple Triad is a game played with special square cards placed on a 3x3 board."
  Show Text "\\rEach card has 4 numbers on it, one per side. These numbers are so-called stats."
  Show Text "\\rPlayers take turns placing cards on the board. As they do so, they try to capture and gain control of their opponent's cards."
  Show Text "\\rThat's where the numbers come in. If a player places a card with a higher number next to a card with a lower number, the player captures that card."
  Show Text "\\rThus, the goal of the game is to gain control of more cards than the other player by the end of the game."
  Goto Choices
When 'Game rules'
  Show Text "\\rThere are a number of optional game rules you can apply to individual games."
  Show Text "\\rThey can affect card stats, how cards capture each other, the scoring and the prizes."
  Goto Choices
When 'Prizes'
  Show Text "\\rWhen you win a game, you will recive 1 random card from your opponent from their Deck."
  Show Text "\\rThis also works the other way around: if you lose, you have to give your opponent one of your cards, chosen at random."
  Show Text "\\rYou can change what you win or lose from a game by using an optional game rule."
